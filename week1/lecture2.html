Overview of Internet Technologies



Hello and welcome to web development in this video we are going to understand the course outline that we are going to following order to understand MERN STACK just pretty well so as you can see that there are quite a few modules that i have created in which i am going to estimate what amount of time we are going to take in order to reach every single important topic that is existing in our course outline,
So as you can see that I have segreggated the entire course outline in 12 separate modules and on the right hand side we can see that what is the amount of estimated time that we are going to reduce in order to finish this entire course module okay so that is what we are going to learn so we are going to pick start our entire journey by learning javascript so java script is a very important programming language for mern stack infact entire complexity of this technology stack is going to be around the programming language of java script.
Java script is a very fun programming language also it has its own rules and regulations that is going to separate it from the remaining programminf languages like java, c++, python, etc.
After learning javascript and even while we are learning javascript as you can see that we are going to focus little bit on html, css also but again the focus on html and css will be very minimum. 
Moving next we are going to start with our very proper introduction to mern stack what it is exactly technology it is like what we can do in order to step the enviornment and how the basic structure of mern stack how it is going to work and stuff like that now we already know that  MERN basically stands for mongodb express react and node and the fourth is gonna embark start of react is a front end part of our mern stack and it is going to play a very important role in understanding the MERN STACK probably it can also be the toughest part to understand in my personal experience to understand in my personal experience for teaching i personally find people learning react a lot of difficulty at the very start.
But with progression with of time we start it easy as per so this where we start react to understand what kind of project we can study architecture and react we will create a very first component we will understand how to understand events and stuff like that we will move our space to two way binding forms and stuff like that moreover we will also see how we can routing deposits the next thing that we are gonna
